- 👋 Hi, I’m @LACarretero
- 👀 I’m on a self learning journey to become a Programmer and a CyberSecurity expert.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, html, CSS and Kali linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every project that is in my scope of knowledge so I can get as much experience as I can. I'm willing to learn from
     anybody who's willing to teach something and will always commit to those who share the knowledge with me. I studied Computer Science for 2 years, 
     but was unable to finish the  carreer. Now at 28 I believe I have the blessing of internet to fill all the gaps left, sand work from the bottom
     up to maybe getting a job that'll let me pay for a decent university or maybe just the certification needed to get a good job. Anyway, right now
     I've spent 200+ hours learning Python3.
